# Object-Light-Race
Project 1
The attached Arduino code is for a neopixel strip 32 points long and an RGB; the strip is split into 2 sets of 16 lights. The players of this game each press a button and try to light up their strip first (one plays red, one plays blue) and the RGB lights up with the winner's color. The game then delays for 5 seconds before resetting.
